IDLE : Integrated devlopment and learning environment
	By default interpreter, editor, runtime environment
IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Python.
=====================================

IDLE features:
1) syntax autocompletion
2) inbuild python modules are available for your programming
=====================================
REPL :- Read Execute print and loop	-Used as a Calculator

Python installer for Windows contains the IDLE module by default.

we use idle for single statement
we can use text editor for python script


IDE: -  Integrator Devlopment Environment
Combines

Difference between python and other languages

===============================================================
Python Object oriented concepts (OOP concepts)
Class : collection of objects, variables, methods. etc. 
Object : instance of class, used to access or call the variables, methods of class
Method: method is the block of code, function which is used to perform 
operations on variables, method takes parameters and can return the result.
Inheritance: inheriting the variables and the functions of parent class from 
the child class and extending the functionality.
===============================================================
OOP Concepts:
Features: 
1) Object : - it is an instance of a class. e.g. Car
2) Class : - it is a collection variables, Functions, Methods, Objects
3) Data abstraction : - it is for data explore. Exploring data from the class to
 the ouside the world by creating objects
4) Data Encapsulation : - it is for security purpose, it is achieved using 
members of class, function doing them private
class can be ex of encapsulation if it is private(not accessible outside the class)
5) Polymorphism : - Overloading
Same method but different signature (different arguments or parameters)
	-performing different operations but using the same methods
with different parameters
6) Inheritance : - Acquring the features (from parents) in the child class 
from the parent class
Types of Inheritance
1) Single: one Parent, one child
2) Multilevel: one parent, then choild again  child
3) Multiple: one parent, multiple child of one parent
================================================================
pip: python package management
package uninstall command: - pip uninstal package_name
Package Install Command: -pip install package_name
